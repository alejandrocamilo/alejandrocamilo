# 👋 Hi there, I'm Alejandro Camilo  
### 🚀 Junior Full Stack Developer  
**Next.js • React.js • Node.js • Express.js • MongoDB • MySQL**

I'm a passionate full stack developer who builds **real-world solutions**, not just practice apps. I specialize in creating **modern UIs with Next.js and React**, and building **robust backends using Node.js and Express**, connected to both **NoSQL (MongoDB)** and **SQL (MySQL)** databases.

### 🧠 What Makes Me Stand Out:
- ✅ I’ve built and deployed production-ready projects from scratch  
- ✅ I apply industry best practices: modular architecture, error handling, and secure authentication  
- ✅ I approach development with a **product-builder mindset**, not just as a coder

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, Auth flows
- **Databases:** MongoDB + Mongoose | MySQL (queries, schema design, relationships)
- **Dev Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman, Nodemailer, Vercel, Render, Railway
